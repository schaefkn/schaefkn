### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Kevin. Currently a Head of Department with several years of hands-on iOS development experience and a proven track record of leading cross-functional teams. Passionate Apple ecosystem advocate (2019 WWDC Scholarship winner) dedicated to bridging technology and business strategy. Whether it's coding innovative app features or collaborating directly with executives to align tech solutions with market opportunities, my goal is always to create exceptional customer experiences and drive meaningful innovation.

Deeply committed to enabling othersâ€”developers, partners, and teams alikeâ€”to unleash their full potential. I thrive when connecting, empowering, and inspiring those around me, fostering environments where creativity and excellence flourish. Driven by a personal motto, "Potenziale Entfalten," my mission is clear: empower developers, build vibrant partnerships, and leave a lasting positive impact on the tech community and beyond.
